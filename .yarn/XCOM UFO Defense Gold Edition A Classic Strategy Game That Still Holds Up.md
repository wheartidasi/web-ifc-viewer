The game was originally released in 1994 and has been praised for its deep gameplay, challenging difficulty, and atmospheric graphics and sound. The Gold Edition includes the original game and its sequel, X-COM: Terror From the Deep, which adds new enemies, weapons, and missions.
 
If you are looking for a classic strategy game that will test your skills and immerse you in a sci-fi world, you can download X-COM UFO Defense Gold Edition from Steam[^1^]. You can also check out some reviews of the game from GameSpot[^2^] and other sources.

The gameplay of X-COM UFO Defense Gold Edition is divided into two main modes: the Geoscape and the Battlescape. The Geoscape is where you manage your global operations, such as building and upgrading bases, intercepting UFOs, and allocating funds and personnel. The Battlescape is where you control your squad of soldiers in turn-based combat against the aliens, using cover, terrain, and various weapons and items.
 
The game offers a lot of variety and challenge, as you have to deal with different types of aliens, each with their own abilities and weaknesses. You also have to research and develop new technologies, such as laser weapons, plasma rifles, and psi-amps, to gain an edge over the invaders. You can also capture and interrogate live aliens to learn more about their origins and motives.
 
X-COM UFO Defense Gold Edition is a game that requires strategic thinking, careful planning, and quick decision-making. It is not an easy game, but it is a rewarding one for those who enjoy a complex and immersive strategy experience.

The sequel to X-COM UFO Defense Gold Edition is X-COM: Terror From the Deep, which is also included in the Gold Edition package. The game takes place 40 years after the events of the first game, when a new alien threat emerges from the depths of the oceans. You have to rebuild X-COM and face new challenges, such as underwater missions, new alien races, and more advanced technology.
 
X-COM: Terror From the Deep is similar to the first game in terms of gameplay and mechanics, but it is also more difficult and complex. The game introduces new features, such as night missions, two-part missions, and more diverse environments. The game also has a darker and more horror-like atmosphere, as you explore sunken ships, ancient ruins, and alien bases.
